# CSC420Project

Create a basic compiler that accepts input from ANTLR and compiles basic C programs for a class project.

This is for a "fake" programming language named MountC that was created in our CSC420 class as the final project.

Project specifications can be found at: http://raider.mountunion.edu/csc/CSC420/Fall2017/project.htm

Thank You!
